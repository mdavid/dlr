# Very simple test of TCPServer

# Currently this is a manual test, until we have threading
# Run the script in MRI or IronRuby, then connect to
# http://127.0.0.1:1234/

# To kill, use Ctrl+C then make a request
# (or kill your command window)

# BUG: currently socket is a builtin in IronRuby
# BUG: also, for some reason we cannot 'rescue' a failed require in IronRuby,
# so instead we try TCPSocket and if it fails require it
